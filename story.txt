Once a upon a time there was a man and women that lived in a speacial forest. They were the protectors of everythingliving and non-living in the forest.

Then one day, the forest came under attack by strong outside forces. these attackers were swift in their approach. wihtin seconds they surrounded all sides of the forest.

The protectors of the forest raise their weapons and aregoing to destroy the attackers.

Today is running, cool. Nice work.

They do a warrior shout and run at the attackers then..... I wake up from a nap. I now finish this assignment.
